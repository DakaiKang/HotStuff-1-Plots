\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The principal goal of this work has been latency reduction for client finality confirmations in streamlined \BFT{} consensus protocols. We demonstrated that \HSOne{} successfully lowers latency algorithmically via speculation,
and furthermore, tackles leader-slowness and tail-forking attacks via slotting.
Additionally, we exposed and resolved the \textit{prefix speculation dilemma} that exists in the context of \BFT{} protocols that employ speculation.
